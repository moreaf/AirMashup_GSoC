<h3><font color='blue' style='font-family: Helvetica;'>Development and production</font></h3>
<pre><font style='font-family: Helvetica;'>The Boeing 777 (Triple Seven) is a long-range wide-body twin-engine jet airliner developed and
manufactured by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It is the world's largest twinjet and has a typical seating
capacity of 314 to 396 passengers, with a range of 5,240 to 8,555 nautical miles (9,704 to 15,844 km).
Commonly referred to as the "Triple Seven",[5][6] its distinguishing features include large-diameter
turbofan engines, long raked wings, six wheels on each main landing gear, fully circular fuselage
cross-section, and a blade-shaped tail cone.[8] Developed in consultation with eight major airlines, the
777 was designed to replace older wide-body airliners and bridge the capacity difference between
Boeing's 767 and 747. As Boeing's first fly-by-wire airliner, it has computer-mediated controls. It was also
the first commercial aircraft to be designed entirely with computer-aided design.

The 777 first entered commercial service with United Airlines on June 7, 1995. The 777 has received
more orders than any other wide-body airliner; as of May 2019, more than 60 customers had placed
orders for 2,033 aircraft of all variants, with 1,598 delivered.The most common and successful variant
is the 777-300ER with 806 delivered and 842 orders; Emirates operates the largest 777 fleet, with 163
passenger and freighter aircraft as of July 2018.The sixth 777 hull loss occurred in October 2016;
the Asiana Airlines Flight 214 accident in July 2013 was its first fatal crash in 18 years of service, and the
shootdown of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in July 2014 is its deadliest crash as of January 2019.

The 777 ranks as one of Boeing's best-selling models; by 2018 it had become the most-produced Boeing
wide-body jet, surpassing the Boeing 747.[14] Airlines have acquired the type as a comparatively
fuel-efficient alternative to other wide-body jets and have increasingly deployed the aircraft on long-haul
transoceanic routes. Direct market competitors include the Airbus A330-300, the Airbus A350 XWB, and
the out-of-production A340 and McDonnell Douglas MD-11. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which entered
service in 2011, shares some design features with the new 777X models.
